# Model SQLCE EF6

This is a DDD model to start a project using SQL Compact (SQL CE) with Entity Framework 6. 
I have made some changes to the original model developed by Damijan Vodopivec in 9 Nov 2013.

Changes:
* Crud based repository included
* Changed the aproach of mapping the domains to separate classes.

Hope you enjoy.
