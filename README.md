# Model DDD + SQLCE + EF6

This is a DDD model to start a project using SQL Compact (SQL CE) with Entity Framework 6. 
This is an adaptation from the original code developed by Damijan Vodopivec in 9 Nov 2013.

Changes:
* Eliminated most classes to simplify to the most, there's only two now: Actor and ActorRole.
* Crud based repository included
* Changed mapping from annotations to fluent api.

Hope you enjoy.
